## Abortion trends in the United States

### Motivation

In light of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade, access to
abortion has been significantly compromised, and even banned, in several
states across the country. Those that are likely to be most impacted by
this decision are individuals that belong to underserved and
marginalized communities. Change in policies could potentially lead to a
variation in abortion trends in the country over time. We can analyze
these trends to understand the implications of policy change in the
country with respect to reproductive rights.
