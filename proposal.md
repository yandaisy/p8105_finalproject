## Abortion trends in New York and Georgia (2016-2020): A Comparative Analysis

### Motivation

In 2019, many conservative states have raced to enact an unprecedented
wave on bans on abortions that have severely restricted women’s
reproductive rights. These restrictions have culminated with the recent
Supreme Court overturning of Roe v. Wade, a landmark supreme court case
granting a women’s right to an abortion. Since then access to abortion
has been significantly compromised, and even banned, in several states
across the country. Those that are likely to be most impacted by this
decision are individuals that belong to underserved and marginalized
communities. Change in policies could potentially lead to a variation in
abortion trends in the country over time. We can analyze these trends to
understand the implications of policy change in the country with respect
to reproductive rights.

Our period of interest is from 2016 to 2020. We will be assessing trends
in abortion rates leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic, where several
abortion clinics closed and people were inclined to stay at home,
underestimating the demand for abortions from 2020 and onwards.

Our areas of interest are New York and Georgia. Both states have
significantly different political alignments and subsequently different
policies and trends relating to abortion access and number of abortions.

### Intended Final Products

Our final project will results in the following:

-   Graphs/dashboards depicting the results of our analysis
-   Report explaining our methodology and findings
-   Interactive website with all components of the project
-   Screencast going through website

### Anticipated Data Sources

New York and Mississippi:

-   Guttmacher Institute:
    <https://data.guttmacher.org/states/table?state=NY+MS&topics=65+66+203+205+152+151+109+110+111+157&dataset=data>

-   NY State Department of Health:
    <https://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/vital_statistics/2019/>

### Planned Analyses / Visualizations / Coding Challenges

**Explanatory analysis**

-   Rate of abortion per 1000 women in New York and Mississippi across 4
    years (2016-2020)
-   Rate of abortion per 1000 women by age in New York and Mississippi
-   Rate of abortion per 1000 women by race/ethnicity in New York and
    Mississippi
-   Rate of abortion per 1000 women by insurance plan in New York and
    Mississippi

**Outcomes of interest**: percent change in abortion rate over time

**Confounder**: race/ethnicity, year, methods (induced vs spontaneous),
age group, SES/income/insurance plan

**Visualizations**:

-   Interactive mapping on abortion laws by state throughout time
    (2016-2020)
-   Bar graph during exploratory analysis when comparing New York to
    Mississippi
-   Interactive mapping of abortion rate over time

**Coding challenges**: Potential challenge in analyzing the data because
they are group-level data
